    "  * Understanding the application domain\n",
    "  * Cleaning and integrating relevant data sources\n",
    "  * Presenting your results clearly to others\n",
    "* Developing mathematical intuition\n",
    "  * Particularly statistics and linear algebra\n",
    "  * Why the concepts were developed, how they are useful, and when they work best\n",

    "### Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "* An experiment is a procedure yielding one of a set of possible outcomes\n",
    "* A _sample space_ $S$ is the set of possible outcomes of an experiment\n",
    "* An _event_ $E$ is a specified subset of the outcomes of an experiment\n",
    "* THe _probability or an outcome_ $s$, denoted $p(s)$, is a number with two properties\n",
    "  * For each outcome $s$ in sample space $S$, $0 \\leq p(s) \\leq 1$\n",
    "  * The sum of probabilities of all outcomes sums to one\n",
    "* The _probability of an event_ $E$ is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes of the experiment\n",
    "* A _random variable_ $V$ is a numerical function on the outcomes of a probability space\n",
    "* The _expected value_ of a random variable $V$ defined on sample space $S$ is ... (equation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability vs. Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probability deals with predicting the likelihood of future events; theoretical math\n",
    "* Statistics involves the analysis of the frequency of past events; applied math\n",
    "* Probability theory enables us to find the consequences of a given ideal world\n",
    "* Statistical theory enables us to measure the extent to which our world is ideal\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compound Events and Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "* Events A and B are independent if and only if (prob of intersection of A and B is equal to prob of A times prob of B):\n",

    "${P(A \\bigcap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)}$"
