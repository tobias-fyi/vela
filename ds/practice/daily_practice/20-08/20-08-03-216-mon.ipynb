    "I worked on a team that included 3 other data scientists/machine learning engineers, 4 web developers, and 2 UX designers to build an app with the goal of reducing the cognitive load of creating and maintaining good recycling habits. In order to do this, myself and the team (3 other DS/ML, 4 web developers, 2 UX designers) knew we had to make it simple, quick, and easy enough that a user could find relevant, useful recycling information one-handed, while walking from the stove to the trash can. Ideally, by the time they reached the trash can, they'd know how to properly dispose of the item they have in their hand.\n",

    "Trash Panda is an app I worked on with a team that included 3 other machine learning engineers, 4 web developers, and 2 UX designers. We had 8 weeks to bring it from a raw idea to deployed, usable application that would help users create and maintain good recycling habits. I worked primarily as a machine learning engineer, collaborating on the pipeline we built to automate the process of gathering, organizing, and labeling 82,000+ images, utilizing those images to train a computer vision (object detection) model, and serving the trained model to be used for inference in the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with general collaboration throughout the process, I was solely responsible for two pieces of the puzzle. The first was to find a way of automatically removing the background from images that had one, which I solved by building a secondary image processing pipeline with another computer vision model (image segmentation). The second was to deploy the trained model for the main app to use, which I accomplished by building a containerized Flask API and deploying it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n",

    "Post Here is another web app I worked on with an interdisciplinary team, this time with only a week to develop and deploy the app. I was the primary machine learning engineer on the team, responsible for developing a recommender system for Reddit subreddits. I used relatively simple natural language processing techniques, along with dimensionality reduction and feature selection, to process the training data, which originally consisted of over 1m Reddit self-posts (text posts). Then, I iterated on a multinomial naive Bayes model to generate the recommendations, working intimately with the data engineer on our team to build and deploy the API used to serve the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal with MediZen was to help medicinal cannabis users discover new strains and manage their experience with those they've tried. Myself and the rest of the data team were responsible for training and deploying the strain recommender system. As the recommendations would be based on each user's preferences — and thus did not have a specific target — we trained an unsupervised nearest neighbors model. I was primarily responsible for building and deploying the API to serve the model, which I did. However, I also ended up training my own iterations of the model after our primary machine learning engineer stopped contributing to the team upon delivering the first iteration.\n",
