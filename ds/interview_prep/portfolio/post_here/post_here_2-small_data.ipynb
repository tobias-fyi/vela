    "Reddit is an expansive site. Anyone who has spent any significant amount of time on it knows what I mean. There is a subreddit for seemingly every topic anyone could ever want to discuss or even think about (and many that most do not want think about).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is a powerful site; a tool for connecting and sharing information with like- or unlike-minded individuals around the world. When used well, it can be a very useful resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the deluge of information that's constantly piling into the pages of can be overwhelming and lead to wasted time. As with any tool, it can be used for good or for not-so-good.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem that Redditors experience, particularly those who are relatively new to the site, is where to post content. Given that there are subreddits for just about everything, with wildly varying degrees of specificity it can be quite overwhelming trying to find the best place for each post.\n",
    "\n",

    "The goal with the Post Here app, as mentioned, is to provide a tool that makes it quick and easy to find the most appropriate subreddits for any given post. A user would simply provide the title and text of the their prospective post and the app would provide the user with a list of subreddit recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations are produced by a model attempts to predict which subreddit a given post would belong to. The model was built using Scikit-learn, and was trained on a large dataset of reddit posts. In order to serve the recommendations to the web app, an API was built using Flask and deployed to Heroku.\n",

    "### My Role\n",
    "\n",
    "I worked on the Post Here app with a remote, interdisciplinary team of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and web developers. I was one of two machine learning engineers on the team, responsible for the entire process of building and training the machine learning models. The two data scientists on the team were primarily responsible for building and deploying the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge we ran into, which directed much of the iterative process, was scope management.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in my machine learning journey, this was one of the larger datasets that I'd taken on. Uncompressed, the dataset we used was over 800mb of mostly natural language text. The dataset and the time constraint—we had less than four full days of work to finish the project—were the primary causes of the challenges we ended up facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a dataset, one important concept we had to keep in mind was the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), which is basically a title for the various problems and phenomena that occur when dealing with extremely highly dimensional datasets. When processed, a natural language dataset of this size would likely fall prey to this curse and may prove somewhat unwieldy without large amounts of processing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up researching and applying various methods of addressing this problem in order to fit the processing/modeling pipeline on the free Heroku Dyno, with a memory limit of 500mb, while preserving adequate performance. Many of our deployments failed because the pipeline, when loaded into memory on the server, exceeded that limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important tradeoff we had to wrangle with was how much, and in what ways we could limit the dataset—i.e. how many classes to try and predict, and how many observations per class to include when training. The original dataset contains data for 1,000 subreddits. It was not within the scope of a a four-day project to build a classification model of a caliber that could accurately classify 1,000 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning, we did try to build a basic model trained on all 1,000 classes. But with the time and processing power I had, it proved to be untenable. In the end, we settled for a model that classified text into 305 subreddits with a test precision-at-k of .75, .88, and .92 for 'k' of 1, 3, and 5, respectively."

   "source": [
    "The dataset we ended up using to train the recommendation system is called the [Reddit Self-Post Classification Task dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mswarbrickjones/reddit-selfposts), available on Kaggle thanks to Evolution AI. The full dataset clocks in at over 800mb, containing 1,013,000 rows: 1,000 posts each from 1,013 subreddits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the dataset, including a nice interactive plot of all the subreddits and their relevance to one another, refer to Evolution AI's [blog post](https://evolution.ai//blog/page/5/an-imagenet-like-text-classification-task-based-on-reddit-posts/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrangling and Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I needed to reduce the size of the dataset. I defined a subset of 12 categories which I thought were most relevant to the task at hand, and used that list to do the initial pruning. Those 12 categories left me with 305 unique subreddits and 305,000 rows. The list I used was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* health\n",
    "* profession\n",
    "* electronics\n",
    "* hobby\n",
    "* writing/stories\n",
    "* advice/question\n",
    "* social_group\n",
    "* stem\n",
    "* parenting\n",
    "* books\n",
    "* finance/money\n",
    "* travel\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I took a random sample of those 305,000 rows. The result was a dataset with 91,500 rows, now consisting of between 250 and 340 rows per subreddit. If I tried to use all of the features (tokens, or words) that resulted from this corpus, even in its reduced state, it would still result in a serialized vocabulary and/or model too large for our free Heroku Dyno. However, the features used in the final model can be chosen based on how useful they are for the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the dataset preview on Kaggle, there are quite a large number of missing values in each of the features—12%, 25%, and 39% of the subreddit, title, and selftext columns, respectively. However, I did not find any sign of those null values in the dataset nor mention of them in the dataset's companion blog post or article. I chocked it up to an error in the Kaggle preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I went about doing some basic preprocessing to get the data ready for vectorization. As described in the description page on Kaggle, newline and tab characters were replaced with their HTML equivalents, `<lb>` and `<tab>`. I removed those and other HTML entities using a simple regular expression. I also concatenated `title` and `selftext` into a single text feature in order to process them together."
