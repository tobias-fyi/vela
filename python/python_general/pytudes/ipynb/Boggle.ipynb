On a 5 by 5 board we would have 25 initial paths of length one.\n",

    "    - `[(0, 0), (1, 0)]`,  `'PU'`: here `'PU'` is a prefix of a word so continue this path.\n",
    "    - `[(0, 0), (0, 1)]`,  `'PW'`: here `'PW'` is not a prefix of any word so do **not** continue this path.\n",

    "Sadly, we were not able to make an improvement in 500 repetitions. But that certainly is no guarantee that `boyan` is the best possible board. Here are some things to try to find a better board; maybe you can implement some of them, or try some ideas of your own:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Genetic algorithms**: We used **mutation** of a single board, but we could also consider **crossover** where we keep a pool of boards and take the first half of one board and combine it with the second half of another.\n",
    "- **Swaps**: We changed one letter at a time. But maybe there is no change of one letter that will improve a board, but there is a change involving two squares, either swapping them or mutating both of them.\n",
    "- **Incremental score calculation**: We modified just one square and then tried to find all the words from scratch. Would it be faster to keep track of which squares contributed to which words, and only re-do the calculations for the one changed square? This would probably involve infixes of words rather than prefixes. Perhaps by keeping track of what each square contributes, we can make a better choice of which square to mutate.\n",
    "- **Random restarts**: When is it best to continue searching from the current board, versus starting over from a new board?"
