    "\n",
    "Reddit is an expansive site. Anyone who has spent any significant amount of time on it knows what I mean. There is a subreddit for seemingly every topic anyone could ever want to discuss or even think about (and many that most do not want think about).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is a powerful site; a tool for connecting and sharing information with like- or unlike-minded individuals around the world. When used well, it can be a very useful resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the deluge of information that's constantly piling into the pages of can be overwhelming and lead to wasted time. As with any tool, it can be used for good or for not-so-good.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem that Redditors experience, particularly those who are relatively new to the site, is where to post content. Given that there are subreddits for just about everything, with wildly varying degrees of specificity it can be quite overwhelming trying to find the best place for each post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to illustrate the point, some subreddits get _weirdly_ specific. I won't go into the _really_ weird or NSFW, but here are some good examples of what I mean by specific:\n",

    "\n",

    "The goal with the Post Here app, as mentioned, is to provide a tool that makes it quick and easy to find the most appropriate subreddits for any given post. A user would simply provide the title and text of the their prospective post and the app would provide the user with a list of subreddit recommendations.\n",

The model was built using Scikit-learn, and was trained on a large dataset of reddit posts.

    "\n",
    "One aspect of natural language processing to keep in mind with such a dataset is the curse of dimensionality. When processed, a natural language dataset of this size would likely fall prey to the curse of dimensionality and prove somewhat unwieldy without large amounts of processing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was forced to research and apply various methods of addressing this problem in order to fit the resulting models on the free Heroku Dyno (500mb) while preserving adequate performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important way I had to wrangle with scope management was in deciding how many classes to try and predict. The original dataset contains data for 1,000 subreddits. It was not within the scope of a a four-day project to build a classification model of a caliber that could accurately classify 1,000 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning, I did try to build a basic model trained on all 1,000 classes. But with the time and processing power I had, it proved to be untenable. In the end, I settled for a model that classified text into 200 subreddits with a test accuracy of over 90%.\n",

    "\n",
    "As seems to be common with NLP projects, the process of wrangling the data was very much intertwined with the modeling process. Of course, this could be said about any machine learning project. However, I feel like it is particularly so in the case of NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this section—the one dedicated to data wrangling only—will be rather brief and basic. I go into much more detail in the Modeling section.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I needed to reduce the size of the dataset. I defined a subset of 12 categories which I thought were most relevant to the task at hand, and used that list to do the initial pruning. Those 12 categories left me with 305 unique subreddits and 305,000 rows. The list I used was as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* health\n",
    "* profession\n",
    "* electronics\n",
    "* hobby\n",
    "* writing/stories\n",
    "* advice/question\n",
    "* social_group\n",
    "* stem\n",
    "* parenting\n",
    "* books\n",
    "* finance/money\n",
    "* travel\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I took a random sample of those 305,000 rows. The result was a dataset with 91,500 rows, now consisting of between 250 and 340 rows per subreddit. If I tried to use all of the features (tokens, or words) that resulted from this corpus, even in its reduced state, it would still result in a serialized vocabulary and/or model too large for our free Heroku Dyno. However, the features used in the final model can be chosen based on how useful they are for the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the dataset preview on Kaggle, there are quite a large number of missing values in each of the features—12%, 25%, and 39% of the subreddit, title, and selftext columns, respectively. However, I did not find any sign of those null values in the dataset nor mention of them in the dataset's companion blog post or article. I chocked it up to an error in the Kaggle preview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I went about doing some basic preprocessing to get the data ready for vectorization. As described in the description page on Kaggle, newline and tab characters were replaced with their HTML equivalents, `<lb>` and `<tab>`. I removed those and other HTML entities using a regular expression. I also concatenated the `title` and `selftext` features into a single text feature in order to process them together."

The key aspect of this process is how to measure the value of the features; how to find which ones are the \"best\". The scoring function I used in this case is called [ch2](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.chi2.html) (chi-squared).\n",

This allowed the deployment to go smoothly while retaining enough information for the model to have adequate performance."
