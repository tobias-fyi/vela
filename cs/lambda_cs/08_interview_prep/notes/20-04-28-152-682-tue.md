# Interview Prep: Day 2

## Behavioral interview practice

1. How would your co-workers describe you?

* Communicative and conscientious
* Dependable in any situation

2. Why should we hire you?

* Great addition to any team
* Always willing to do whatever it takes to get things done
* Try to inspire those around me to be better

3. What's your dream job?

A multi-disciplinary company with lots of collaboration and flexibility, which is in an
industry that can utilize the power of data to improve everyone's lives, such as
education, environment, or other areas of science. And where I am happy to come to work
because everyone else is happy to be there.
