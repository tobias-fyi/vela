    "\n",
    "I'm a data scientist and engineer, software and machine learning engineer, writer, and musician currently living in Denver, Colorado. I hold a BS in Economics from Cal Poly, SLO, where I also competed as a Division I springboard diver.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've worked on a number of teams to develop useful and usable applications, such as a subreddit recommendation system and an object detection API that classifies over 70 types of waste (see my Projects section below). Building things and working with people is how I learn best, and I'm always looking for opportunities to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "I relish any opportunity to solve a problem, simple or complex, and always hold myself and those around me to a high standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a child I was encouraged to teach myself everything I wanted to learn and to entertain myself without a TV (we didn’t have one). Contrary to what a surprising number of people believe, these two areas of life go hand in hand. Learning was my entertainment—and still is.\n",
    "\n",
    "My unique upbringing instilled in me what I believe is the most important lesson of all: how to be a lifelong learner. For me, learning did not start nor end with my academic education; life is a continuous learning process. I have a deep passion not only for the challenge of learning new skills and studying new disciplines, but also for practicing and refining those I already have.\n",
    "\n",
    "From anchoring the news to analyzing millions of data points; from training and performing as a vocalist to developing a market for wall-climbing robots; from shooting and editing video to writing technical essays on topics such as the economics of real estate or photosynthetic production of plastic; from surfing trips in exotic locations around the world to flying all over the country on a weekly basis implementing enterprise-level software; from designing, printing, and selling t-shirts to saving enough to try out semi-retirement for a couple years—I am very proud of the variety of academic, professional, and life experiences I’ve had.\n",
