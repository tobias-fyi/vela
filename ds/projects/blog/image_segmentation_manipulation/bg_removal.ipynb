Images could then be downloaded and processed without any manual image processing needed. That was the idea anyways, and we did get it working.\n",

We imagined what it would be like to install Photoshop on a server, but figured that Jerry-rig was not worth the trouble.\n",

Basically, with image segmentation, each individual pixel is classified as either an object or not an object, with multiple object classes per image possible. The result is an image like the following, with the object, or as I'd been referring to it, the \"foreground\" of the image perfectly outlined and masked.\n",

    "from this perspective, the binary mask generated via Detectron2 or Mask R-CNN simply classifies each pixel as a 1 or a 0 (hence the binary descriptor). Therefore, with the image and mask as arrays of the same shape, it really just comes down to inverting the mask so that the background is the 1, and subtracting that area from the original image.\n",
    "\n",
