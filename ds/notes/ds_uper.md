### The Data Science Process

Reading up, formulating, and synthesizing ideas about a framework for data science problem solving.

#### Framework for Experimental Design

1. Formulate the research question
2. Identify variables: independent vs dependent
3. Generate hypothesis
4. Determine experimental design
    * How am I going to test the hypothesis?
    * What variables will be involved?
5. Develop experimental task & procedure
    * What algorithms and techniques best support the experiment design
6. Detemine data manipulation & measurements
7. Analyze results

#### [5 Steps of a Data Science Project Lifecycle](https://tinyurl.com/5-steps-ds-lifecycle)

This article goes through the "OSEMN" framework, which is pretty much what the title says: steps for a data science project. I'm looking for things more along the lines of experimental design, but I'll read through this anyways.

1. Obtain - Gather data from relevant sources
2. Scrub - Clean data to formats that humans and/or machines can understand
3. Explore - Find significant patterns and trends using statistical methods
4. Model - Construct models to predict and forecast
5. Interpret - Put the results to good use

Pretty straightforward. What I'm talking about with regards to experiment design goes deeper than this and includes steps like defining the problem and designing the experiment, along with the above steps.

#### [The Data Science Process](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/03/data-science-process.html)

1. Frame the problem
    * By the end of this stage, have all of the information and context needed to solve the problem
2. Collect the raw data needed for the problem
    * Think through what data is needed and finding ways of getting that data
3. Process the data for analysis
    * Check for and fix missing or corrupted data, incorrect data types or formats, etc.
4. Explore the data
    * Once the data is clean, start playing with it!
    * Prioritize looking for answers to questions relevant to the problem and that are likely to produce insights
    * Look for patterns
5. Perform in-depth analysis
    * Apply statistical, mathematical, and technological knowledge
    * Leverage data science tools
    * Crunch the data and extract the insights
6. Communicate results of the analysis
    * Make the stakeholders understand why the insights are important
    * Craft a compelling story that ties the data to their knowledge

## Points to Clarify Up Front

* The size and shape of the dataset
* Data types
