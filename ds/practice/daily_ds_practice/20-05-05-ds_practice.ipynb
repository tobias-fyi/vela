    "\n",
    "As seems to be the case with most, if not all, machine learning projects, we spent the\n",
    "vast majority of the time gathering and labeling our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, our model would be able to recognize any object that anyone would\n",
    "ever want to throw away. But the reality is that this is practically impossible,\n",
    "particularly within the 8 weeks we had to work on Trash Panda.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were granted an API key from Earth911 to utilize their recycling center search\n",
    "database. When we were working with it, the database held information on around 300\n",
    "items—how they should be recycled based on location, and facilities that accept them if\n",
    "they are not curbside recyclable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had our starting point for the list of items our system should be able to\n",
    "recognize. However, the documentation for the neural network architecture we'd decided\n",
    "to use suggested that to create a robust model, it should be trained with at least\n",
    "1,000 instancesi (in this case, images) of each of the classes we wanted it to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gathering 300,000 images was also quite a bit out of the scope of the project at that\n",
    "point. So the DS team spent many hours reducing the size of that list to something a\n",
    "little more manageable and realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main method of doing so was to group the items based primarily on visual\n",
    "similarity. We knew it was also out of the scope of our time with the project to train\n",
    "a model that could tell the difference between #2 plastic bottles and #3 plastic\n",
    "bottles, or motor oil bottles and brake fluid bottles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also considered the items that 1) users would be throwing away on a somewhat\n",
    "regular basis, and 2) users would usually either be unsure of how to dispose of properly\n",
    "or would dispose of properly."
