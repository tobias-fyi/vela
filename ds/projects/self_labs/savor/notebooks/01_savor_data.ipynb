    "> Take advantage of your own big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Savor is a project based on an idea that I first had in 2016. At the time I was working as a consultant for an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software company. I worked intimately with manufacturers to integrate our system into their business, with the goal of optimizing their manufacturing processes. I became fascinated by the idea of tracking things to such a degree, and began to imagine what it would be like to have a similar type of system that would optimize my life.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the core idea: building a system to organize my life as if it were a series of manufacturing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way of saying it may initially make it seem impersonal. I believe it's the opposite, in fact. The goal is to use software to understand myself better. That's where the tagline comes from — I'd like to take advantage of my own big data to make my life better in whatever ways I see fit at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies like Google and Facebook have been taking advantage of my big data for years, with the primary goal of making money. In the process of segmenting and profiling me, they likely know a lot about me. I'd like to have a similar data-driven profile of my life, for my own purposes. Namely, to learn more about myself and my life, to be able to optimize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess it's at this point that I can see people rolling their eyes and thinking this is just another productivity app. Words like \"optimize\" don't help things. However, I want to get across the fact that because I have total control over this system, that I get to choose exactly how it gets used and precisely what is optimized. While sometimes this optimization would come in the form of making myself more productive, it's equally likely that I'll want to optimize the length of time and quality of connection I have with family and friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that: a system that can help you find time to spend with family and friends, and find mindsets and/or conversation topics that will most likely increase the quality of those connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that sounds like the opposite of impersonal — getting intimate with oneself on levels and to a degree potentially not possible before.\n",

    "\n",
    "The latest data model I came up with for my journal is one that has 3 distinct layers (with more to come in proceeding iterations).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Project Log\n",
    "2. Engagement Log\n",
    "3. Moment Log\n",
    "\n",
    "The naming was not completely arbitrary, though could definitely be improved — the names aren't perfectly self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the reason I broke it up has to do with something I noticed about how my time is spent. At the top level, I try to work on a single \"project\" for a certain period of time. This helps me stay focused on what I wanted to do/work on during that time. Another way to think about it is that this level defines overarching parts of the day, usually somewhere between 5 and 10, depending on what I'm doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each block of time (maybe that's a better name right there — \"block\") I can switch between specific activities, such as between coding, writing, and reading/research. That is the second level, with each individual activity assigned to that higher level block. This second level is where the vast majority of the action is; the level where I spend most of my time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third level is for very short activities I do that aren't necessarily related to the main activity. For example, I could be working on the notebook to explore this data but take short little breaks to get water, use the restroom, or clear my head. In the previous iteration of the data model I didn't account for these little activities — every activity was \"created equal\", so to speak, and in order to account for that time, I'd have to split up and duplicate the main activity record, interspersing the short breaks into them that way. Simply put, that caused too much overhead sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal with this project is to reduce the time and effort required to keep a real-time journal to the point where it doesn't interrupt what I'm actually doing."
